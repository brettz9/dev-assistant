# Web Developer Assistant

Web Developer Assistant offers tools of convenience to developers.

I am currently salvaging components from Developer Assistant to
retool as web applications, potentially integrating into a future
webextensions add-on.

The repository may still contain old relics as I migrate components.
Those which have already been or are being migrated are listed below.

(For the old add-on as copied from source control, see the
`dev-assistant-addon` tag, and see [PR #1](https://github.com/brettz9/dev-assistant/pull/1)
for some code apparently added after that in the original repository.)

## Current functionality that has been reimplemented:

The following have been reimplemented, at least to a minimally functional
degree:

- XPath tester

## To-dos

### XPath to-dos

1. Add back load/save buttons (reimplement portions possible of
    `loadsaveutils.js`)
1. Reimplement keyset
1. Reapply splitter between input/output
1. Reapply ability to persist width/height, screenX/screenY,
    and height of splitter

## History

[Developer Assistant](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/extension-developer/)
was an add-on for Firefox. It was originally called Extension Developer
Extension and was created by Ted Mielczarek, with code contributed by
Jesse Ruderman, CÃ¼neyt Yilmaz, Tony Chang, Gavin Sharp, Cesar Oliveira,
Nickolay Ponomarev, and Brett Zamir.

With Ted no longer actively maintaining the project, Brett Zamir accepted
to take over the project.
